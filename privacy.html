      <h4 class="text-left my-5">Privacy Policy</h4>
      <p>This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) sets out the basis which <b>Silence Library</b> (“we”, “us”, or “our”) may
        collect, use, disclose or otherwise process personal data of users in accordance with the Personal Data
        Protection Act (“PDPA”). This Policy applies to personal data in our possession or under our control, including
        personal data in the possession of organisations which we have engaged to collect, use, disclose or process
        personal data for our purposes.

      <h5>Personal Data</h5>
      1. As used in this Policy:“member” means a member of Silence Library, whether practising or otherwise; “customer”
      means an individual who <br>(a) has contacted us through any means to find out more about any goods or services we
      provide, or <br>(b) may, or has, entered into a contract with us for the supply of any goods or services by us;
      and “personal data” means data, whether true or not, about a customer who can be identified: <br>(i) from that
      data; or <br>(ii) from that data and other information to which we have or are likely to have access.
      <br>
      <br>2. Depending on the nature of your interaction with us, some examples of personal data which we may collect
      from you include name, residential address, email address and telephone number.
      <br>
      <br>3. Other terms used in this Policy shall have the meanings given to them in the PDPA (where the context so
      permits).
      <br>
      <br>
      <h5>Collection, Use and Disclosure of Personal Data</h5>
      4. We generally do not collect your personal data unless <br>(a) it is provided to us voluntarily by you directly
      or via a third party who has been duly authorised by you to disclose your personal data to us (your “authorised
      representative”) after <br>(i) you (or your authorised representative) have been notified of the purposes for
      which the data is collected, and <br>(ii) you (or your authorised representative) have provided written consent to
      the collection and usage of your personal data for those purposes, or <br><br>(b) collection and use of personal
      data without consent is permitted or required by the PDPA or other laws. We shall seek your consent before
      collecting any additional personal data and before using your personal data for a purpose which has not been
      notified to you (except where permitted or authorised by law).
      <br>
      <br>5. We may collect and use your personal data for any or all of the following purposes:
      <br>(a) operating our website and/or its subdomains (“Website”);<br>(b) performing our statutory functions and
      administering our activities; <br>(c) communicating with our members and customers; <br>(d) updating your personal
      and contact information; <br>(e) performing obligations in the course of or in connection with our provision of
      the goods and/or services requested by you; <br>(f) verifying your identity; <br>(g) responding to, handling, and
      processing queries, requests, applications, complaints, and feedback from you; <br>(h) managing your relationship
      with us; <br>(i) processing payment or credit transactions; <br>(j) complying with any applicable laws,
      regulations, codes of practice, guidelines, or rules, or to assist in law enforcement and investigations conducted
      by any governmental and/or regulatory authority; <br>(k) statistical, analysis, planning and reporting; <br>(l)
      any other purposes for which you have provided the information; and <br>(m) any other incidental purposes related
      to or in connection with the above.
      <br>
      <br>6. This Policy does not apply to aggregated information which summarises statistical information about groups
      of members, and which does not include name, contact information, or any other information that would allow any
      particular individual to be identified.
      <br>
      <br>7. We may disclose your personal data:
      <br>(a) where necessary to enforce the Terms of Use; <br>(b) where such disclosure is required for performing
      obligations in the course of or in connection with our provision of the goods and services requested by you;
      <br>(c) to third party service providers, agents and other organisations we have engaged to perform any of the
      functions with reference to the above mentioned purposes; <br>(d) if required by law or in the good faith belief
      that such action is necessary to: <br>(a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal processes served
      on us or the Website; <br>(b) protect and defend our rights or property; and <br>(c) act under exigent
      circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Website; or <br>(e) where your consent has been
      obtained for disclosure.
      <br>
      <br>8. Where your use of the Website is concerned, you acknowledge and accept that certain functions, when
      activated or used by you, will operate to send or display information about yourself, including but not limited
      to, your personal data to certain third parties, and you agree to the sharing of such information with these third
      parties. You acknowledge and agree that we shall not be held responsible or accountable for any loss, injury or
      damage sustained by you for sharing the aforesaid information arising out of your activation or use of such
      features on the Website.
      <br>
      <br>
      <h5>Withdrawing Your Consent</h5>
      9. The consent that you provide for the collection, use and disclosure of your personal data will remain valid
      until such time it is being withdrawn by you in writing. You may withdraw consent and request us to stop
      collecting, using and/or disclosing your personal data for any or all of the purposes listed above by submitting
      your request in writing or via email to our Data Protection Officer at the contact details provided below.
      <br>
      <br>10. Upon receipt of your written request to withdraw your consent, we may require reasonable time (depending
      on the complexity of the request and its impact on our relationship with you) for your request to be processed and
      for us to notify you of the consequences of us acceding to the same, including any legal consequences which may
      affect your rights and liabilities to us. In general, we shall seek to process your request within ten (10)
      business days of receiving it.
      <br>
      <br>11. Whilst we respect your decision to withdraw your consent, please note that depending on the nature and
      scope of your request, we may not be in a position to continue providing our goods or services to you and we
      shall, in such circumstances, notify you before completing the processing of your request. Should you decide to
      cancel your withdrawal of consent, please inform us in writing in the manner described in clause 9 above.
      <br>
      <br>12. Please note that withdrawing consent does not affect our right to continue to collect, use and disclose
      personal data where such collection, use and disclose without consent is permitted or required under applicable
      laws.
      <br>
      <br>
      <h5>Access to and Correction of Personal Data</h5>
      13. If you wish to make <br>(a) an access request for access to a copy of the personal data which we hold about
      you or information about the ways in which we use or disclose your personal data, or <br>(b) a correction request
      to correct or update any of your personal data which we hold about you, you may submit your request in writing or
      via email to our Data Protection Officer at the contact details provided below.
      <br>
      <br>14. Please note that a reasonable fee may be charged for an access request. If so, we will inform you of the
      fee before processing your request.
      <br>
      <br>15. We will respond to your request as soon as reasonably possible. In general, our response will be within
      thirty (30) business days. Should we not be able to respond to your request within thirty (30) days after
      receiving your request, we will inform you in writing within thirty (30) days of the time by which we will be able
      to respond to your request. If we are unable to provide you with any personal data or to make a correction
      requested by you, we shall generally inform you of the reasons why we are unable to do so (except where we are not
      required to do so under the PDPA).
      <br>
      <br>
      <h5>Protection of Personal Data</h5>
      16. To safeguard your personal data from unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification,
      disposal or similar risks, we have introduced appropriate administrative, physical and technical measures.
      <br>
      <br>17. You should be aware, however, that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic
      storage is completely secure. While security cannot be guaranteed, we strive to protect the security of your
      information and are constantly reviewing and enhancing our information security measures.
      <br>
      <br>
      <h5>Accuracy of Personal Data</h5>
      18. We generally rely on personal data provided by you (or your authorised representative). In order to ensure
      that your personal data is current, complete and accurate, please update us if there are changes to your personal
      data by informing our Data Protection Officer in writing or via email at the contact details provided below.
      <br>
      <br>
      <h5>Retention of Personal Data</h5>
      19. We may retain your personal data for as long as it is necessary to fulfil the purpose for which it was
      collected, or as required or permitted by applicable laws.
      <br>
      <br>20. We will cease to retain your personal data, or remove the means by which the data can be associated with
      you, as soon as it is reasonable to assume that such retention no longer serves the purpose for which the personal
      data was collected, and is no longer necessary for legal or business purposes.
      <br>
      <br>
      <h5>Transfers of Personal Data Outside of Singapore</h5>
      21. We generally do not transfer your personal data to countries outside of Singapore. However, if we do so, we
      will obtain your consent for the transfer to be made and we will take steps to ensure that your personal data
      continues to receive a standard of protection that is at least comparable to that provided under the PDPA.
      <br>
      <br>
